** Separate the application logic
I want to be able to:

- have all controllers defined in their own directory.
  This allows the decoupling of the controllers from the view.
- The view must have an easy way to interact with the model
- The controllers must take into account react's model

*** implementation
The <App> provides the global model to the app through context.
That takes into account the react model.

When changes will occur on the model, the app will render the new model.
